These specialized or pretrained document models enable higher levels of accuracy, especially with custom document layouts, and always output the same core concepts (“schema”). We have grouped some of these specialized models into bundles that address high-value use cases.</p><p>It is important to note that Document AI has been designed to address a customer’s end-to-end document workflow – but not necessarily the full business workflow. For example, Document AI can help a customer classify and extract information from an invoice, but it does not address the full accounts payable process. Customers can either integrate the Document AI API into their existing workflows (on their own, or with a systems integrator), or they can work with ISV / SaaS providers who leverage Document AI directly.</p></body></html>"
